    <p> World War 2 was the most deadly war in history, with more than 70 million deaths. This website highlights what happened during the early parts of the war. </p>
    <br>
    <h2> 1939 </h2>
    <br>
    <h3> Invasion of Poland </h3>
    <p> On September 1st, 1939, Germany began its invasion of its neighboring country, Poland. This is the start of WW2. The Allies had warned Germany not to invade Poland, but Germany did anyway. The Polish could not stand against the Germans, as the Germans had superior technology and tactics. The Polish Cavalry couldn't stand up against the German tanks. Not only that, but a little later, The Soviets started invading from the other side, and the Allies still hadn't sent help! In a few weeks, Poland fell. </p>
    
    <p> After Poland fell, the Allies and Germany had a long starting contest for the rest of 1939. This allowed Germany to begin stockpiling troops. </p>
    <br>
    <h2> 1940 </h2>
    <br>
    <h3> The Winter War </h3>
    
    <p> The Winter War technically started on November 30th of 1939, but the majority of the major events happened during 1940. The Winter War started because the Soviet Union wanted more land and thought that Leningrad, one of their biggest cities, was too threatened. So they demanded that Finland, The USSR's neighbor, give them some territory so that the city was less exposed. Finland said no, so the USSR declared war. This war did not go very well for the Soviets though, as they were not doing very well. The Soviet Union lost thousands of tanks and other armored vehicles. They also lost over 150,000 troops in the war while Finland lost a little over 25,000 troops.In exchange for those losses, the Soviet Union took 11% of Finland’s territory at the time. </p>
    <br>
    <h3> Operation Weserübung </h3>
    
    <p> Operation Weserübung was Germany's invasion of Denmark and Norway. The invasion of Denmark and Norway began on April 9th of 1940. Denmark surrendered within 6 hours, meanwhile German ships occupied Norwegian ports and troops landed in multiple key areas in Norway. The Allies were quick to respond to this, as they landed troops to aid the Norwegians. The Germans had captured multiple air bases though, and the air superiority decided the battle. The Germans soon conquered all of Norway. Operation Weserübung was a success.</p>
    <br>
    <h3> Fall Gelb </h3>
    
    <p> Fall Gelb is the German invasion of the Benelux nations and France. The invasion began on May 10th of 1940, as the Germans pushed through Luxembourg, Belgium, and The Netherlands. The Allies, who hadn't been allowed to move troops into any of the Benelux countries, immediately came to their aid, but the French decided against defending the Ardennes, a region of thick forests thought to be naturally impenetrable. The Germans took advantage of this and pushed multiple tanks through the Ardennes and trapped the Allied troops in Belgium by cutting them off from France. The encircled troops retreated to the port of Dunkirk and were either evacuated or destroyed.</p>
    
    <p> After the evacuation, the French had lost a large amount of their troops, meaning that their defense was extremely weakened. The Germans quickly blitzed through the Rest of France, taking Paris, the French capital. France surrendered soon after the fall of Paris, and the Germans set up a puppet state known as Vichy France. </p>
    <br>
    <h4> Battle of Britain </h4>

    <p> Shortly after France fell, the Germans set their focus on Britain. They started planning out a plan to invade Britain, known as Operation Sea Lion. They started by trying to gain air superiority over Britain, leading to multiple engagements between the British Royal Air Force and the German Luftwaffe. The Luftwaffe was winning for a while, as they were bombing RAF bases, but the RAF decided to conduct an insignificant bombing of Berlin. The Luftwaffe stopped bombing air bases and was ordered instead to bomb population centers in Britain. This allowed the British to repair their planes and in a single engagement, the RAF destroyed a large number of Luftwaffe planes, securing British air superiority, meaning that the Germans could not carry out Operation Sea Lion yet.</p>
    <br>
    <h3> Italian Invasion of Greece </h3>
    
    <p> After watching the Germans victories, Germany's ally, Italy, decided to invade Greece, thinking that they could easily beat the Greek. Italy sent 7 divisions to invade Greece from Albania. This went horribly for the Italians, as they were halted a few miles from the border by the Greek, then they were pushed into Albania by a Greek counteroffensive. Not only that, but the British decided to aid Greece with troops and planes.</p>
    <br>
    <h2> 1941 </h2>
    <br>
    <h3> Balkans Operation </h3>
    
    <p> After watching the failure of the Italians, Germany pressured Bulgaria and Yugoslavia to join the Axis so Germany could aid the Italians. However, when Yugoslavia joined the alliance, the government of Yugoslavia was overthrown, infuriating Hitler. Germany decided to invade both Yugoslavia and Greece. On April 6th, 1941, Germany began the invasion. They swept through Yugoslavia, who surrendered on April 17th, and then through Greece who surrendered on the 22nd of April. All of the Balkans, except for the Greek island of Crete (held by the British), was controlled by the Axis. Soon, the Germans began an invasion of Crete, which saw heavy losses, but in turn, the British evacuated the island. </p>
    <br>
    <h3> North Africa </h3>
    
    <p> In North Africa, the British had been having great success. They were pushing the Italians out of Cyrenaica (a region of modern day Libya). By this time, the British decided to send troops to Greece. When they were defeated, the British defenses in the region were weakened, allowing a young German officer by the name of Erwin Rommel, to attack the British positions. Within a few days, Rommel had taken all of Cyrenaica except for the city of Tobruk back. The British decided to go on the counteroffensive, and were successful, taking back the region. </p>

    <h5> The Eastern Front </h5>

    <p> The Eastern Front of WW2 was brutal for both sides of the war. On June 22, 1941, the Third Reich and its allies began an invasion of the unprepared Soviet Union. This invasion is currently the largest invasion in history. The Soviets could not keep up with the Axis's speed. This led to many problems for the USSR. The Germans managed to pull off multiple encirclements, taking hundreds of thousands of troops prisoner and killing more. The Axis forces had managed to pull off multiple great things. They took important cities such as Kiev (now Kyiv), Minsk, and Smolensk. They had also cut off the Soviet city of Leningrad (now St. Petersburg), a massive city that was very important to the USSR, and were also threatening Moscow, the Soviet capital. However, the tides were beginning to turn in the favor of the Soviet Union, as winter was coming. With winter coming, the Axis started to lose steam, not knowing what was to happen in the years coming. The early part of the war had ended.</p>
