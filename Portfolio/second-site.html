        <p> The Battle of Stalingrad is by far the most bloody battle of history. As a comparison, here is a list of the 3 bloodiest battles during WW2.</p>
        <ol>
            <li> Battle of Stalingrad: 2+ million killed or wounded</li>
            <li> Battle of Moscow: 1.6 million killed or wounded</li>
            <li> Siege of Leningrad: 1.5 million killed or wounded</li>
        </ol>
        <p> This battle was so monumental that it was the battle marked as the turning tide of the war. It is one of the most well-known battles in history. How did it happen?</p>
        <p> After the Soviet's counterattack in the winter of 1941-1942, Germany drew up new plans for the summer campaign. They decided that it would be best to seize a region known as the Caucasus Region as Germany could use the oil fields in the region to continue fueling the war effort.</p>
        <p> On June 28th, 1942, Germany began to plan to conquer the region. The plan was to move General Friedrich Paulus's 6th Army aided by the 1st Panzer Army to capture the city of Stalingrad. If the city was captured, the Caucasus Region would be virtually cut off from the rest of the USSR. However, the 1st Panzer army was redirected to go elsewhere, meaning that the 6th Army was to capture the city by themselves. The Soviets put up a great defense to keep the Germans outside of the city, but eventually, the Germans managed to penetrate the city's suburbs. The Soviet 62nd Army led by General Vasily Chuikov was determined to hold the city for as long as they could until reinforcements came.</p>
    
        <h7> Operation Uranus</h7>
        <p> Operation Uranus was the Soviet counterattack against the 6th army. The plan is initiated on November 19th of 1942. The Operation was a great success and managed to encircle the German 6th Army, trapping the troops in the city. The Germans tried to reestablish a connection to the city, but they failed. The 6th Army eventually surrendered on 1942-February 2nd, 1943</p>

        <h4> The Battle of D-Day/Normandy</h4>
        <h3> June 6th, 1944-August 30th, 1944</h3>

        <p> The Battle of D-Day is arguably the single-handed most important battle in all of World War 2. D-Day/Normandy is also known as Operation Overlord, an intricately planned out operation designed to begin the end of the war in Europe. This is what happened.</p>

        <h7> The Plan</h7>
        <p> After a long time of careful planning, the Allied commanders, led by Supreme Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Forces Dwight D. Eisenhower, had come up with a plan to invade Germany by sea. First, airborne divisions were to drop in on key points such as bridges, supply depots, and artillery positions. Then landing forces were to land on 5 beaches on the coast of Normandy. The Beaches were code-named Utah, Omaha, Gold, Juno, and Sword. The Americans were assigned to the beaches Utah and Omaha, the British to Gold and Sword, and the Canadians to Juno. On June 5th, 1944, Supreme Commander Eisenhower announced that Operation Overlord was to happen the next day. The Allies had managed to build up a massive invasion force including 3,000 landing craft, 2,500 other non-military ships, 500 warships, 13,000 planes, and a total of 133,000 troops. On June 6th, 1944, the invasion began.</p>

        <h7> The Landings</h7>
        <p> The airborne divisions landed and were mostly successful, as most objectives were taken. Soon the landing craft had landed on the beaches. By 6:30 AM, the British and Canadians at Gold, Sword, and Juno had overcome the German defenses, soon followed by the Americans at Utah, but the Americans at Omaha were having a lot of trouble with the veteran troops of the 352nd division. The Americans at Omaha were eventually victorious, at the cost of around 2,000 casualties. The Germans were slow to respond to the impending threat of the Allies due to the fact that Hitler controlled what divisions did, and he was asleep during the beginning of the invasion. Eventually, the 21st Panzer Division was sent to attack the British and Canadian positions. The British and Canadians put up a hard fight and managed to push the Germans back after massive fighting.</p>
