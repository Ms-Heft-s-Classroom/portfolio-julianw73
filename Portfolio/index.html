        <p> My fist website is a website that tells you about the earlys years of WW2. It will tell you a few of the campaigns, fronts, and battles during the Second World War.</p>
            <br>
        <h5> My Second Website</h5>
         <br>
        <img src="images/D-Day Picture.jpg" alt="Picture of the famous Battle of D-Day">
        <h6> Public Domain picture </h6>
             <br>
        <p> My second website is also about World War 2, but it only highlights a major battle. It talks about the Battles of Stalingrad and D-Day/normandy.</p>
            <br>
        <p> The only reason I am able to code this website is because of my coding class. It is a fun and interactive class where I get to see my results very quickly. I have so far learned a lot in html and css. This class gave me the skill to format this website and decorate it.</p>
        <p>This website began creation on <time datetime="2023-10-13"> October 13, 2023</time>. </p>
